**Huberman App: Holistic Testing Strategy**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Huberman App project, encompassing both the backend (Laravel) and frontend (React Native) components. The primary goal is to ensure the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, secure, and user-friendly application that meets all functional and non-functional requirements. This strategy adopts a multi-layered approach, integrating various testing types throughout the development lifecycle.

**2. Testing Objectives**

*   **Verify Requirements:** Ensure the application functions according to the defined user stories and acceptance criteria (`user_stories_mvp.md`).
*   **Prevent Regressions:** Detect defects introduced by new code changes or refactoring early in the cycle.
*   **Build Confidence:** Provide confidence to the team, stakeholders, and users in the application's stability and correctness before release.
*   **Early Defect Detection:** Identify and fix bugs as early as possible in the development process, reducing the cost and effort of remediation.
*   **Ensure Quality Attributes:** Validate non-functional requirements, including performance, security, and usability.

**3. Testing Levels & Scope**

We will employ a balanced mix of automated and manual testing across different levels:

*   **Level 1: Unit Tests**
    *   **Scope:** Focus on testing the smallest isolated parts of the codebase (individual functions, methods, classes, components, hooks, utils). Dependencies are typically mocked or stubbed.
    *   **Backend (Laravel):** Test model logic, service class methods, form request validation rules, utility functions. Follows TDD principles outlined in `backend_implementation_todo.md`.
    *   **Frontend (React Native):** Test individual UI components' rendering and basic interactions, utility functions, state management logic (store actions/reducers/selectors), custom hooks.
    *   **Goal:** Verify the correctness of individual code units, fast feedback for developers.
    *   **Execution:** Run locally by developers during development, automatically in the CI pipeline on every commit/PR.

*   **Level 2: Integration Tests (Backend)**
    *   **Scope:** Verify the interaction and communication between multiple backend modules or components (e.g., Controller -> Service -> Repository/Model, Event -> Listener). May involve interaction with a test database and cache.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure different parts of the backend work together as expected.
    *   **Execution:** Run locally by developers, automatically in the CI pipeline.

*   **Level 3: Component Tests (Frontend)**
    *   **Scope:** Test React Native components with more complex interactions, including state changes, prop handling, and basic rendering within a simulated environment, but without full navigation or backend APIs.
    *   **Goal:** Verify component behavior and integration with state management or child components.
    *   **Execution:** Run locally by developers, automatically in the CI pipeline.

*   **Level 4: API / Contract Tests (Backend)**
    *   **Scope:** Test the backend API endpoints directly, verifying adherence to the defined contract (`openapi.yaml`). Check request validation, authentication/authorization logic, response structure, status codes, and basic business logic execution.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the API behaves as expected from an external consumer's perspective (the frontend) and prevent breaking changes.
    *   **Execution:** Run locally by developers (Laravel Feature Tests), automatically in the CI pipeline.

*   **Level 5: End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
    *   **Scope:** Simulate real user scenarios by interacting with the complete, deployed application (React Native app interacting with the backend API in a dedicated test/staging environment).
    *   **Goal:** Validate complete user flows from start to finish across the entire stack.
    *   **Execution:** Run primarily in Staging environment. Due to complexity, initial focus might be on automating critical paths (e.g., login, core free feature, subscription purchase, core premium feature access). May run nightly or on-demand rather than every commit. Can be supplemented heavily by manual testing initially.

*   **Level 6: Manual Exploratory & Acceptance Testing**
    *   **Scope:** Human-driven testing involving unscripted exploration of the application to uncover usability issues, edge cases, and unexpected behavior. Also includes scripted testing based on user story acceptance criteria.
    *   **Goal:** Catch issues missed by automated tests, validate the user experience, confirm requirements are met from a user perspective. Includes Design QA (comparing implementation to Figma designs).
    *   **Execution:** Performed primarily on Staging builds by QA, Product Owners, and Designers.

*   **Level 7: Security Testing**
    *   **Scope:** As defined in `security_plan.md`. Includes SAST, DAST, and planned external Penetration Testing.
    *   **Goal:** Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Execution:** SAST in CI pipeline. DAST periodically on Staging. Penetration testing before major releases.

*   **Level 8: Performance Testing**
    *   **Scope:** Assess backend API response times under simulated load, frontend app startup time, screen transition performance, memory usage.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the application meets performance expectations and scales appropriately.
    *   **Execution:** Primarily post-MVP or before major releases on a Staging environment resembling production. Initial checks via developer tools during development.

*   **Level 9: Usability Testing**
    *   **Scope:** Observing representative users interacting with the application to perform specific tasks.
    *   **Goal:** Identify usability friction points and gather qualitative feedback on the user experience.
    *   **Execution:** Planned sessions coordinated by UX designers/researchers, likely conducted periodically during development and before major launches.

**4. Tools & Technologies**

*   **Backend Unit/Integration/API:** PHPUnit
*   **Frontend Unit/Component:** Jest, React Native Testing Library (RNTL)
*   **Frontend E2E:** Detox / Appium / Maestro (Selection TBD based on team expertise/needs)
*   **SAST:** PHPStan/Psalm (Backend), ESLint + Security Plugins (Frontend)
*   **DAST:** OWASP ZAP (Initial), potentially commercial scanners later.
*   **Performance:** k6/JMeter (Backend Load), React Native Perf Monitor/Flipper (Frontend Profiling)
*   **Manual Testing/Management:** Jira/Trello (Test Cases/Bug Tracking), potentially TestRail/Zephyr
*   **Device Testing:** BrowserStack / Sauce Labs (or physical device pool)

**5. Roles & Responsibilities**

    *   Write and maintain Unit, Integration, and Component tests for their code.
    *   Write API/Contract tests (Backend).
    *   Run tests locally before committing code.
    *   Fix bugs identified during testing.
    *   Participate in code reviews focusing on testability and coverage.
    *   Integrate and run SAST tools.
    *   Contribute to E2E test automation (optional/based on skill).
    *   Conduct initial performance profiling.
*   **QA Engineers / SDETs (if applicable):**
    *   Develop and execute manual test plans and exploratory testing.
    *   Develop and maintain automated E2E tests.
    *   Perform regression testing.
    *   Manage bug tracking process.
    *   Execute DAST scans.
    *   Coordinate acceptance testing.
*   **Designers:**
    *   Perform Design QA against implemented features.
    *   Conduct usability testing.
*   **Product Owners / Managers:**
    *   Define acceptance criteria for user stories.
    *   Participate in acceptance testing.

*   **DevOps / Infrastructure:**
    *   Maintain testing environments.
    *   Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Configure monitoring for performance and errors.

**6. Testing Environments**

*   **Local:** Developers run Unit, Integration, Component, API tests during coding.
*   **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automated execution of Unit, Integration, Component, API tests, and SAST checks upon code commits/PRs. Build failures block merges.
*   **Staging:** Deployed environment closely resembling production. Used for Manual QA, Acceptance Testing, E2E automation runs, DAST scans, Performance testing.
*   **Production:** Live environment. Testing is limited to essential post-deployment smoke tests and ongoing monitoring.

**7. Integration with Development Process**

*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated tests (Levels 1-4) are mandatory gates in the CI pipeline. A failing build prevents code merging. E2E tests may run separately (e.g., nightly).
*   **Definition of Done (DoD):** A user story or task is considered "Done" only when:
    *   Code is implemented according to requirements.
    *   Relevant unit, integration, component, and API tests are written and passing.
    *   Code passes CI checks (including SAST).
    *   Code is peer-reviewed.
    *   Functionality is successfully tested by QA (manual/automated E2E) in Staging.
    *   Design QA is completed (if applicable).
    *   Acceptance criteria are met (verified by PO).
    *   Documentation (code comments, relevant diagrams, READMEs) is updated.

**8. Bug Tracking & Reporting**

*   **Tool:** Jira/Trello will be used for tracking bugs identified during any testing phase.
*   **Process:** Bugs will be reported with clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, severity/priority, environment details, and relevant screenshots/logs. Bugs will be assigned, prioritized, fixed, and then verified by QA in the Staging environment before closure.

**9. Conclusion**

This holistic testing strategy provides a framework for ensuring the quality and reliability of the Huberman App. By combining automated tests at various levels with thorough manual testing, security checks, and performance considerations, integrated tightly with the CI/CD pipeline and Definition of Done, we aim to deliver a robust and user-trusted application. This strategy will be reviewed and adapted as the project progresses.

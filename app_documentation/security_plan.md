**Huberman App: Security Plan**

**1. Introduction**

Security is a critical aspect of the Huberman App, especially considering user data, authentication, and subscription payments. This document outlines the plan for integrating security practices throughout the development lifecycle, including threat modeling, defining specific technical controls, and planning for security testing. The goal is to build a secure and trustworthy application by proactively identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities.

**2. Detailed Threat Modeling**

*   **Process:**
    *   A dedicated threat modeling session will be conducted early in the implementation phase, involving backend developers, potentially frontend developers, and project leads.
    *   The **STRIDE methodology** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) will be used as a framework.
    *   The analysis will focus on key data flows and components based on the detailed technical design (`component_interfaces_interactions.md`, `complex_workflows.md`) and API contract (`api_design_documentation.md`), specifically targeting:
        *   Authentication flow (Registration, Login, Password Reset, Token Handling)
        *   Subscription lifecycle management (IAP, Webhooks, Status Updates)
        *   Feature Gating logic (Free vs. Premium access)
        *   User-generated content (Notes - storage, access control, potential public sharing)
        *   API endpoints (Input validation, Authorization checks)
        *   Data storage (Database, Cache)
        *   Third-party integrations (Payment providers, Push notification services)
    *   For each component/flow, potential threats based on STRIDE categories will be identified, documented, and ranked based on potential impact and likelihood.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   A documented Threat Model (e.g., in a separate document linked here, or appended).
    *   This model will list identified threats, potential attack vectors, existing planned mitigations (from this document), and any additional required security controls or areas needing further investigation.
    *   This document will serve as a living reference, revisited if major architectural changes occur.

**3. Specific Technical Security Controls**

Based on the architecture, known best practices, and anticipated threats, the following technical security controls will be implemented and verified:

**3.1. Authentication & Session Management**

*   **Mechanism:** Laravel Sanctum for API token authentication.
*   **Token Strategy:**
    *   Issue API tokens upon successful login/registration.
    *   Tokens will have a configured expiration time (e.g., configurable, potentially hours or days for mobile usability, balancing security and UX). *Decision: Initially target [e.g., 7 days] expiry, review based on UX/security needs.*
    *   Refresh tokens are *not* part of Sanctum's default API token flow; re-authentication will be required after token expiry. Consider Sanctum's SPA authentication if persistent sessions are strongly desired and feasible with React Native setup, but API tokens are simpler initially.
*   **Password Policy:** Enforce minimum password complexity (e.g., length, character types) during registration and password reset using Laravel validation rules.
*   **Brute-Force Protection:** Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (`/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) using Laravel's built-in rate limiter or dedicated packages.
*   **Secure Storage:** Passwords stored securely using Laravel's default hashing mechanism (Bcrypt).

**3.2. Authorization**

*   **Backend Enforcement:** All authorization decisions MUST be made on the backend (Laravel). No reliance on client-side (React Native) checks for controlling access to data or features.
*   **Subscription Checks:** Use dedicated Middleware (e.g., `CheckPremiumAccess`) applied to API routes/groups requiring premium status. This middleware will leverage the `SubscriptionServiceInterface` to check for an active, valid premium subscription (status `active` or `trialing`, within `ends_at` date).
*   **Ownership & Policies:** Use Laravel Policies (e.g., `NotePolicy`, `ReminderPolicy`) to ensure users can only access and modify their own resources (preventing Insecure Direct Object References - IDOR). Policies check `user_id` matches the authenticated user.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure API endpoints only return data necessary for the specific function.

**3.3. Encryption**

*   **In Transit:** Enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) for all communication between the React Native app and the Laravel API. Configure web server (via Forge/Vapor) for HTTPS only, potentially with HSTS headers.
*   **At Rest:** Leverage database encryption-at-rest features provided by the managed PostgreSQL provider (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL). Confirm this is enabled during infrastructure setup.
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   API keys, database credentials, payment provider secrets, and other sensitive configuration MUST NOT be hardcoded in the repository.
    *   Use environment variables (`.env` file locally, secure environment variable injection via Forge/Vapor in deployed environments).
    *   Consider using a dedicated secrets manager (like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault) for production keys if complexity warrants it later.

**3.4. Input Validation & Sanitization**

*   **Validation:** Use Laravel Form Requests for validating all incoming data from API requests (query parameters, request bodies). Define strict validation rules for data types, formats, lengths, presence, etc.
*   **Output Encoding:** Use Blade's default encoding (`{{ }}`) if rendering any user content in web views (less likely for API). For API responses, ensure proper JSON encoding handles special characters. Avoid rendering user-provided content directly as HTML in the frontend without appropriate sanitization/encoding (React Native generally handles this well).
*   **Sanitization:** While strict validation is key, sanitize input specifically intended for database queries where complex filtering might occur, although Eloquent/Query Builder typically provides protection against SQL injection.

**3.5. Payment Security**

*   **IAP Receipt Validation:** All Apple App Store and Google Play In-App Purchase receipts MUST be validated server-side by sending them from the Laravel backend to the respective provider's validation endpoints. Do not trust client-side validation results.
*   **Webhook Security:** Securely handle incoming webhooks from payment providers (Stripe/Paddle/Apple/Google) by:
    *   Verifying the request signature using the provider's secret key (configured via environment variables). Reject any requests with invalid signatures.
    *   Processing events idempotently where possible (e.g., check if the subscription status is already updated before applying the change again).

**3.6. Dependency Management**

*   **Scanning:** Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies:
    *   Backend: Run `composer audit` locally and/or in the CI pipeline.
    *   Frontend: Run `npm audit` locally and/or in the CI pipeline.
*   **Updates:** Keep dependencies reasonably up-to-date, prioritizing security patches. Use tools like GitHub Dependabot to automate update pull requests.

**3.7. General Security**

*   **Security Headers:** Configure appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, potentially `Content-Security-Policy` if serving any web content) via web server or middleware.
*   **Error Handling:** Configure Laravel error reporting to avoid exposing sensitive information (stack traces, database details) in production API responses. Return generic error messages for 5xx errors.
*   **Logging:** Implement sufficient logging to track key security events (e.g., login attempts, password resets, subscription changes, significant errors), but avoid logging sensitive data like passwords or full payment details. Centralize logs for monitoring.

**4. Security Testing Planning**

Security testing will be integrated throughout the development lifecycle:

*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
    *   **Tools:** Configure static analysis tools like PHPStan/Psalm with security-focused extensions (e.g., `psalm/plugin-security-analysis`) for the backend. Use ESLint with security plugins (e.g., `eslint-plugin-security`) for React Native frontend code.
    *   **Integration:** Run SAST tools locally via Git hooks (optional) and mandatorily within the CI/CD pipeline on every commit/pull request to catch potential issues early.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**
    *   **Timing:** Periodically run DAST scans against the deployed application in the Staging environment.
    *   **Tools:** Initially, consider using OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) for basic automated scanning of common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi - though less likely with framework defaults, still worth checking). Explore more advanced tools or services if budget allows later.
*   **Manual Code Review:** Encourage security-focused code reviews as part of the standard pull request process, especially for critical areas like authentication, authorization, and payment handling.
*   **Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Timing:** Schedule external penetration testing by a reputable third-party vendor before the first major production launch and potentially before subsequent major feature releases or annually.
    *   **Scope:** Define the scope to cover key application functionality, including authentication, subscription flows, premium feature access, notes handling, API endpoints, and infrastructure configuration.
    *   **Budget:** Allocate budget and time for engaging penetration testing services and remediating identified findings.

**5. Incident Response (Basic Considerations)**

*   While a full incident response plan is beyond this scope, basic readiness includes:
    *   Having access to centralized logs.
    *   Defining communication channels for reporting and handling security incidents.
    *   Understanding how to quickly revoke compromised credentials or disable features if necessary.

**6. Conclusion**

This security plan provides a framework for building security into the Huberman App from the ground up. By implementing the defined technical controls, performing regular testing, and fostering a security-aware development culture, we aim to significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and protect user data and trust. This plan should be treated as a living document and updated as the application evolves.

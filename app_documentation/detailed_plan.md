**Huberman App (Optimize Guide): Implementation Preparation Plan**

**1. Transition Summary**

We have successfully completed the high-level application description and architectural blueprint phases for the Huberman App. The architecture outlines a Modular Monolith (Laravel/PHP backend), a React Native frontend, PostgreSQL database, Redis caching/queuing, and a RESTful API, all designed to support the defined Freemium subscription model. This document details the next crucial phase: transitioning from the architectural vision to actionable technical specifications, project setup, and environment preparation necessary to initiate development efficiently and effectively. The objective is to establish a solid foundation for the implementation lifecycle.

**2. Detailed Technical Design & Specifications**

This phase focuses on refining the high-level architecture into granular component designs and technical specifications.

*   **Component Breakdown (Modular Monolith):**
    *   **Process:** Decompose the Laravel backend into logical, domain-driven modules (Namespaces/Folders). Based on the architecture and features, initial modules will likely include: `Authentication`, `UserManagement`, `SubscriptionBilling` (integrating with chosen payment provider/Cashier), `ContentManagement` (Episodes, Protocols, Summaries), `ProtocolEngine` (Reminder logic, Tracking), `NotesService`, `CommunityFeatures` (if applicable early), and `CoreApi`.
    *   **Outcome:** Clearly defined code boundaries and responsibilities within the Laravel application structure.
*   **Component Interfaces & Interactions:**
    *   **Process:** Define the specific internal contracts (Service Classes, Interfaces, Events) for how these backend modules interact. Document the flow of data and control, especially for cross-cutting concerns like subscription status checks. For frontend-backend interaction, focus on the API.
    *   **Outcome:** Documented internal interaction patterns (e.g., Sequence Diagrams for key flows) and clear responsibilities for each module.
*   **API Design & Documentation:**
    *   **Process:** Formalize the RESTful API contract. Utilize OpenAPI (Swagger) specification to define all endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication methods (Laravel Sanctum/Passport), and authorization requirements. Explicitly tag endpoints requiring 'Premium' subscription status. Key areas include: Auth (login, register, password reset), User Profile, Plans/Subscriptions (fetching offers, potentially linking to provider portals), Content (fetching episodes, protocols, summaries - with filtering for free/premium), Notes (CRUD, public/private flags), Reminders (CRUD for premium), Tracking (logging adherence for premium). Define error handling standards (HTTP status codes, error response structure). Define webhook endpoints for payment providers (Stripe/Paddle, Apple App Store Server Notifications, Google Play Developer API).
    *   **Outcome:** A version-controlled `openapi.yaml` or `swagger.json` file serving as the definitive API contract for both frontend and backend teams.
*   **Database Schema Refinement:**
    *   **Process:** Review the provided `database_plan.md` SQL schema. Convert it into Laravel Migrations. Finalize data types, constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE), foreign key relationships (with appropriate ON DELETE behavior - e.g., CASCADE for notes on user delete, RESTRICT for plans on active subscriptions). Define necessary indexes based on anticipated query patterns (e.g., indexing `subscriptions.user_id`, `subscriptions.status`, `subscriptions.ends_at`, `notes.user_id`, `notes.episode_id`, `protocols.category`). Plan for potential future schema evolution using migrations.
    *   **Outcome:** A complete set of executable Laravel migration files checked into version control, representing the definitive database structure.
*   **Complex Workflow/Algorithm Design:**
    *   **Process:** Document the specific logic for complex features identified in the architecture:
        *   **Subscription Lifecycle Management:** Detail the state machine for subscriptions (`trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, `expired`) and how webhook events from Stripe/Paddle/Apple/Google trigger state transitions and update the `subscriptions` table.
        *   **Feature Gating Logic:** Specify the implementation details for Laravel Middleware/Policies that check the user's active subscription status (querying `subscriptions` table, potentially using cached flags from Redis) before granting access to premium API routes or features.
        *   **Customizable Reminders (Premium):** Design the scheduling mechanism (likely using Laravel's Task Scheduling + Queues) to trigger push notifications based on user-defined times/frequencies for specific protocols.
        *   **Tracking & Visualization Logic (Premium):** Define how adherence data is stored and how it will be aggregated for progress visualizations (e.g., streak calculation).
    *   **Outcome:** Sequence diagrams, state diagrams, or pseudo-code documenting the core logic for these critical flows.
*   **Technology Version & Library Finalization:**
    *   **Process:** Lock down specific versions: PHP (e.g., 8.2+), Laravel (e.g., 10.x/11.x), PostgreSQL (e.g., 17), Redis (e.g., 7.x), Node.js (LTS for React Native tooling), React Native (latest stable). Select and document key libraries: `laravel/cashier-stripe` or `laravel/cashier-paddle`, `react-native-iap`, Push Notification library (e.g., `react-native-push-notification` or cloud provider SDKs), state management for RN (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand).
    *   **Outcome:** Updated `composer.json`, `package.json`, and potentially a project README or Architecture Decision Record (ADR) listing finalized versions and libraries.

**3. Project Planning & Development Readiness**

Translate the technical design into a manageable project plan and prepare the team.

*   **Requirements Refinement (User Stories):**
    *   **Process:** Break down the features from `app_description.md` (both Free and Premium tiers) into granular User Stories (e.g., "As a Free User, I want to see summaries for foundational protocols so that I can understand the basics," "As a Premium User, I want to set a custom daily reminder for 'Morning Sunlight Viewing' so that I don't forget," "As a Premium User, I want to mark a protocol as completed for the day so that I can track my adherence"). Use a tool like Jira or Trello. Prioritize stories for an MVP, focusing on core free functionality and the subscription mechanism first, followed by premium features.
    *   **Outcome:** A populated backlog of estimated User Stories in the chosen project management tool.
*   **Detailed Estimation:**
    *   **Process:** Estimate the effort for each User Story based on the detailed technical designs (e.g., using Story Points or time estimates). This should be done collaboratively by the development team.
    *   **Outcome:** Estimated backlog providing a basis for timeline creation.
*   **Granular Project Timeline & Milestones:**
    *   **Process:** Develop a sprint-based or Kanban-based timeline. Define key milestones:
        *   M1: Project Setup Complete (Repo, CI/CD Base, Local Env).
        *   M2: Core Backend Ready (Auth, User Mgmt, DB Migrations, Basic API Shell).
        *   M3: Basic Content Display (Free Tier Protocols/Summaries visible in RN App).
        *   M4: Subscription Flow PoC (IAP Integration, Backend Webhooks, Basic Feature Gate).
        *   M5: Free Tier Feature Complete (Basic Reminders, Notes).
        *   M6: Premium Feature Set 1 (e.g., Full Content Access, Custom Reminders).
        *   M7: Premium Feature Set 2 (e.g., Tracking, Offline Access).
        *   M8: Beta Release / Production Readiness.
    *   **Outcome:** A documented project plan with sprints/phases, milestones, and dependencies visualized.
*   **Resource Allocation:**
    *   **Process:** Assign development team members (Backend Devs, Frontend RN Devs, QA, potentially DevOps support) to specific modules, epics, or sprints based on skills and availability.
    *   **Outcome:** Clear ownership of tasks/modules within the team.
*   **Essential Tooling Setup:**
    *   **Process:** Configure and grant access to necessary tools:
        *   Project Management: Jira/Trello board setup.
        *   Version Control: GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository creation, branch strategy definition (e.g., Gitflow).
        *   Communication: Slack/Teams channel setup.
        *   Documentation: Confluence/Notion space creation for technical docs, ADRs, meeting notes.
    *   **Outcome:** Operational project infrastructure ready for team use.
*   **Development Environment Configuration:**
    *   **Process:** Finalize and distribute the Docker configuration (`docker-compose.yml`) as specified in the architecture. Ensure it includes containers for PHP-FPM, Nginx/Caddy, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Node.js (for frontend tooling). Provide clear instructions for setup and usage. Standardize environment variable management (e.g., `.env` files with templates).
    *   **Outcome:** Developers can quickly and consistently set up identical local development environments.

**4. UI/UX Design Integration (If Applicable)**

If not already completed, this is a critical parallel activity, especially for the React Native frontend.

*   **Process:** Ensure finalized, high-fidelity mockups and prototypes are available and signed off. These must cover:
    *   All key user flows (onboarding, browsing content, setting reminders, taking notes, tracking progress).
    *   Clear visual differentiation between Free and Premium features/content.
    *   User-friendly prompts and flows for upgrading to Premium.
    *   Platform-specific design conventions (iOS/Android).
    *   Creation of a component library/design system for consistency.
*   **Outcome:** Signed-off UI/UX designs and a style guide/component library ready for frontend development.

**5. Infrastructure & Environment Setup**

Prepare the cloud/hosting environments required beyond local development.

*   **Infrastructure Planning:**
    *   **Process:** Based on the Laravel Forge/Vapor choice, plan the specific server sizes/configurations (if using Forge) or review Vapor's serverless scaling model. Estimate initial database (PostgreSQL) and cache (Redis) resource needs (using managed services). Plan for object storage (S3/GCS) for potential offline content or user uploads.
    *   **Outcome:** Documented infrastructure requirements and initial sizing estimates.
*   **Cloud Service Selection:**
    *   **Process:** Confirm choices: Forge/Vapor for hosting, AWS RDS/Managed Postgres provider, AWS ElastiCache/Managed Redis provider, S3/GCS for storage. Set up accounts if necessary.
    *   **Outcome:** Finalized list of cloud services and providers.
*   **Environment Provisioning:**
    *   **Process:** Use Forge/Vapor (or Terraform/Pulumi if more control is desired) to provision the initial Dev, Staging, and Production environments. This includes setting up servers/services, databases, caches, and configuring network access/security groups.
    *   **Outcome:** Functional cloud environments ready for deployment.
*   **Monitoring, Logging, Alerting Setup:**
    *   **Process:** Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, Sentry, CloudWatch, Prometheus/Grafana) into the provisioned environments. Configure basic logging aggregation (e.g., Vapor logs, CloudWatch Logs, ELK stack). Set up initial alerts for critical events (e.g., high error rates, server down, high DB connections). Integrate Laravel Telescope for Dev/Staging.
    *   **Outcome:** Foundational observability infrastructure in place.
*   **Backup & Recovery Planning:**
    *   **Process:** Configure automated database backups (e.g., using RDS snapshots or provider tools) with defined retention policies. Document the recovery procedure (e.g., restoring from a snapshot).
    *   **Outcome:** Initial backup strategy implemented and documented.

**6. Security Deep Dive & Planning**

Integrate security rigorously from the start.

*   **Detailed Threat Modeling:**
    *   **Process:** Conduct a threat modeling session (e.g., using STRIDE) based on the detailed technical design, data flows, and features (especially authentication, subscription handling, user notes, potential community features). Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Outcome:** A documented threat model identifying key risks and potential attack vectors.
*   **Define Specific Technical Security Controls:**
    *   **Process:** Based on the threat model and architecture, define concrete security controls:
        *   **Authentication:** Specify token expiry, refresh token strategy, password complexity rules, brute-force protection (rate limiting).
        *   **Authorization:** Detail the implementation of Laravel Policies/Middleware for checking `subscriptions.status` for premium features. Ensure no business logic relies solely on client-side checks.
        *   **Encryption:** Enforce TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS), confirm database encryption at rest, define secure storage for API keys/secrets (e.g., environment variables injected via Forge/Vapor, potentially a secrets manager).
        *   **Input Validation:** Define strategy (e.g., Laravel Form Requests) for validating all incoming API request data.
        *   **Payment Security:** Reiterate server-side validation of IAP receipts and secure webhook handling (signature verification).
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Plan for tools like `composer audit`, `npm audit`.
    *   **Outcome:** A checklist or document detailing specific security controls to be implemented and verified.
*   **Security Testing Planning:**
    *   **Process:** Plan for integrating security testing into the development lifecycle:
        *   **SAST:** Configure static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm, ESLint security plugins) to run locally and/or in CI.
        *   **DAST:** Plan for using basic dynamic analysis tools against the Staging environment later in the cycle.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Allocate budget/time for external penetration testing before major production launches.
    *   **Outcome:** Security testing activities integrated into the project plan and CI/CD strategy.

**7. CI/CD Pipeline Foundation**

Automate the build, test, and deployment process early.

*   **Process:** Set up the initial CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, or Jenkins) connected to the version control repository. Configure initial stages:
    *   Trigger on push/merge to `develop` and `main` branches.
    *   Checkout code.
    *   Install dependencies (`composer install`, `npm install`).
    *   Run linters and static analysis (SAST tools).
    *   Run automated tests (Unit, Integration - e.g., `php artisan test`, `npm test`).
    *   Build frontend assets (`npm run build`).
    *   (Initial) Deploy script targeting the Dev/Staging environment using Forge CLI/API or Vapor CLI deployment commands.
*   **Outcome:** A basic, functional CI/CD pipeline that automates testing and deployment to lower environments, ready to be expanded as the project progresses.

**8. Initiation of Development**

With the detailed plans and setup complete, development can commence.

*   **Process:** The development team begins implementation based on the prioritized backlog (User Stories), detailed technical designs, API specifications, and established environment/tooling setup.
*   **Initial Focus:**
    *   Setting up the base Laravel and React Native project structures.
    *   Implementing core database migrations (Users, Plans, Subscriptions, initial Content tables).
    *   Building the Authentication flow (backend API and frontend screens).
    *   Establishing basic API communication between frontend and backend.
    *   Setting up the basic subscription scaffolding (e.g., integrating Laravel Cashier, defining Plan models).
*   **Outcome:** Development kickoff, focusing on foundational components and demonstrating core connectivity.
